# A User-Space TCP/IP Stack in Rust

This project is a personal learning exercise to build a partial TCP/IP stack from scratch in pure Rust. It operates entirely in user-space by creating and managing a tun network interface on Linux, allowing it to function as a virtual network card. The stack can currently parse raw IPv4 packets and the enclosed TCP segments, validating their checksums to ensure integrity. Its core functionality includes handling the server-side of the TCP three-way handshake, enabling it to successfully establish a connection with standard clients like curl. Once a connection is in the ESTABLISHED state, the stack can receive and process basic data payloads sent via PSH/ACK segments, correctly acknowledging the received data to the client. It also includes signal handling to gracefully clean up the network interface and associated firewall rules upon termination.
